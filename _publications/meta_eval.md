title: "A Meta-Evaluation of Faithfulness Metrics for Long-Form Hospital-Course Summarization"
collection: publications
excerpt: "We benchmark faithfulness metrics against fine-grained human annotations for model-generated summaries of a patient's Brief Hospital Course. We meta-evaluate a broad set of proposed faithfulness metrics and, across metrics, explore the importance of domain adaptation (e.g. the impact of in-domain pre-training and metric fine-tuning), the use of source-summary alignments, and the effects of distilling a single metric from an ensemble of pre-existing metrics. Off-the-shelf metrics with no exposure to clinical text correlate well yet overly rely on summary extractiveness. As a practical guide to long-form clinical narrative summarization, we find that most metrics correlate best to human judgments when provided with one summary sentence at a time and a minimal set of relevant source context."
