title: "From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarization with Chain of Density Prompting"
collection: publications
excerpt: "Our primary contributions are to: Develop a prompt-based iterative method (CoD) for making summaries increasingly entity dense; Conduct both human and automatic evaluation of increasingly dense summaries on CNN/Dailymail articles to better understand the tradeoff between informativeness (favoring more entities) and clarity (favoring fewer entities); Open source GPT-4 summaries, annotations, and a set of 5,000 unannotated CoD summaries to be used for evaluation or distillation."
