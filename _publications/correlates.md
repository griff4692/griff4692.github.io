title: "What are the Desired Characteristics of Calibration Sets? Identifying Correlates on Long Form Scientific Summarization"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'On three diverse scientific long-form summarization datasets (spanning biomedical, clinical, and chemical domains), we find, among others, that faithfulness calibration is optimal when the negative sets are extractive and more likely to be generated, whereas for relevance calibration, the metric margin between ranked candidates should be maximized and surprise minimized.'
