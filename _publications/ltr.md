title: "Learning to Revise References for Faithful Summarization"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'To improve reference quality while retaining all data, we propose a new approach: to selectively rewrite unsupported reference sentences to better reflect source data. We automatically generate a synthetic dataset of positive and negative revisions by corrupting supported sentences and learn to revise reference sentences with contrastive learning. The intensity of revisions is treated as a controllable attribute so that, at inference, diverse candidates can be over-generated-then-rescored to balance faithfulness and abstraction.'
