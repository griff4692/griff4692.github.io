title: "Generating EDU Extracts for Plan-Guided Summary Re-Ranking"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'A standard language model (a BART LM) auto-regressively generates elemental discourse unit (EDU) content plans with an extractive copy mechanism. The top K beams from the content plan generator are then used to guide a separate LM, which produces a single abstractive candidate for each distinct plan. We apply an existing re-ranker (BRIO) to abstract candidates generated from our method, as well as baseline decoding methods, and show improved relevance metrics (ROUGE and BERTScore) for top ranked summaries on widely used single document news article corpora (CNN / Dailymail, NYT, Xsum). A human evaluation on CNN/DM validates these results.'
