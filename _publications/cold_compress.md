title: "Cold-Compress 1.0: A Hackable Toolkit for KV-Cache Compression"
collection: publications
excerpt: "Cold Compress, an open source toolkit for KV Cache compression research, unifies SOTA methods like Heavy Hitters, SWA, and Attention Sinks under a flexible, modular API. Built on GPT-Fast for optimal performance, it supports customizable strategies across layers and attention heads, offering a lightweight yet powerful platform for researchers to implement advanced compression techniques. Cold Compress maintains the impressive performance of GPT-Fast by ensuring that all KV cache operations are static and torch compilable. The end result is a toolkit that strikes a balance between simplicity and performance, making it both accessible to all and performant enough for experimentation."
