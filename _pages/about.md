I'm the head of Clinical NLP at Stability and leading efforts to responsibly build open-source large language models for clinical and biomedical applications. In particular, I am focused on efficient training by careful construction of real and synthetic data.

I am soon to be a Computer Science PhD student at Columbia University advised by No√©mie Elhadad. I have a Masters in NLP (2017) from the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon, advised by Eric Nyberg, and I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Dartmouth (2014).

Previously, I've worked at Microsoft Research, Amazon Web Services, OpenEvidence, Flatiron Health, Deutsche Bank, and IBM Watson.
