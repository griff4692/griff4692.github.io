I'm a PhD student at Columbia University advised by No\'emie Elhadad and Kathleen McKeown. My research centers on text summarization, with a particular focus on the summarization of a patient's clinical records. My research is funded by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) as a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow. 

While at Columbia, I've completed NLP internships with Microsoft Research and Amazon. I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics from Dartmouth (2014) and a Masters in NLP (2016) from the Language Technologies Institute (LTI) at Carnegie Mellon, advised by Eric Nyberg. 

Previously, I have held full-time positions at Deutsche Bank, IBM Watson, and Flatiron Health.
